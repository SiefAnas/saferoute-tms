# Overnight 2026-09-30: progress

Live log for the 10-task overnight run. The **latest entry is at the bottom**; it alone is enough to resume.

## Setup and conventions
- Repo: `C:\Users\anas2\saferoute-tms` (main checkout, used for the build branches).
- Reports + this file: branch `overnight-reports`, checked out as a git worktree at
  `C:\Users\anas2\saferoute-reports` (so docs can be committed without switching branches).
- Every build branch starts from `origin/main` at `71367cb` (bulk-import is merged there).
- Tests: `cd server && npm test` (24+ suites, embedded Postgres, ~10 min). Client: `cd client && npx tsc -b && npx vite build`.
  Only one suite run at a time (suites use fixed ports). After a run, stray embedded `postgres.exe`
  processes from `saferoute-tms\server\node_modules\@embedded-postgres` can be killed.
- Never: push to main, merge, open a PR, delete a branch, touch Neon or any remote DB/API.
- **"Full suite before every push", as applied to `overnight-reports`:** that branch's code is
  identical to `origin/main`; it only adds files under `docs/`. The suite was run once on
  `origin/main` code (baseline below). Docs-only commits cannot change the result, so progress
  and report pushes on this branch are not each preceded by a new 10-minute run. Every build-branch
  push gets its own full run. Say so if you want a run before every docs push too.

## Log
### Setup — done
- Baseline full suite on origin/main (71367cb): 24/24 pass. (Suite 14 failed once when I ran suite 25
  at the same time; alone it passes 62/62. Lesson: never run two suites concurrently.)

### Task 1 — tenant-isolation-audit — in progress
- Branch `tenant-isolation-audit` (from origin/main). Not pushed yet.
- Part A (route audit): read every route + raw-SQL service; findings drafted (claim takeover of
  placeholders; student at any school_id; cross-tenant email probe; 200-empty on a foreign
  adjustments list).
- Part B: `server/test/25-tenant-isolation.test.cjs` written, passes 27/27 alone (PG 5475, app 5982).
- Left: write docs/tenant-isolation-audit.md (on overnight-reports), full suite on the branch, commit, push.
- Next step: write the report.
